        "    - The __call__ method in Python is a special (magic) method that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. Essentially, if a class defines __call__, then its objects become callable.\n",
        "    - Purpose of __call__\n",
        "        * Function-like Objects : Encapsulate both state and behavior in one object that can still be called like a function.\n",
        "        * Callback Handlers : Objects with __call__ can be used as callbacks in frameworks or libraries that expect functions.\n",
        "        * Decorator Classes :  Classes that implement __call__ can act as decorators.\n",
        "        * Customizable Function Behavior : You can store configuration in the object and have __call__ behave differently depending on internal state.\n",
